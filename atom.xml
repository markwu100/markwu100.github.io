I just didn’t graduate from Harvard. I got pretty close, but I started to get movie roles and didn’t finish all my courses. So you can imagine how excited I was when President Reif called to invite me to speak at the MIT commencement. </p><p>我都没个大学文凭，我就是没从哈佛毕业。差点就毕业了，但我开始接触电影开始演戏，并没有完成所有的课程。所以，你可以想象，莱夫校长邀请我到麻省理工毕业典礼上讲话我有多激动。</p><p>My brother Kyle and I, and my friend Ben Affleck never really amounted to much.One of the scenes in Good Will Hunting was based on something that actually happened to my brother. Kyle was visiting a physicist we knew at MIT, and he was walking down the Infinite Corridor. He saw those blackboards that line the halls. So my brother, who’s an artist, picked up some chalk and wrote an <strong>incredibly elaborate</strong>, totally fake, version of an equation. It was so cool and so completely <a href="http://dict.hjenglish.com/w/insane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insane</a> that no one erased it for months. This is true.</p><p>我和我的兄弟卡尔、还有我的朋友本·阿弗莱克都没有太了不得。《心灵捕手》其中一幕就是根据我兄弟的真人真事拍的。卡尔当时在麻绳理工访问一名我们认识的物理学家，他一路沿着无尽长廊走，看到了大厅连成行的黑板。于是乎，我的兄弟卡尔这位艺术家，拾起粉笔，精心写下了完全凭空杜撰的方程。写得相当酷炫、几近疯狂，好几个月都没人擦去。这是真的，确有其事。</p><p>But like I said, we later made a movie here. Which did not go unnoticed on campus. In fact I’d like to read you some actual lines, some selected passages, from the review of Good Will Huntingin the MIT school paper.</p><p>如我所说，后来我们在那儿拍了电影，在校园里并没有引起注意。实际上，我想读几句台词给你们听，读些麻省理工校报上《心灵捕手》影评选段给你们听。</p><p><img src="/2019/02/01/马特达蒙麻省理工2016毕业演讲/3.jpg" alt=""></p><p>You’re working on some crazy stuff in these buildings. I’ll tell you one that’s been on my mind: Simulation Theory. There’s a philosopher named Nick Bostrom at Oxford, and he’s postulated that if there’s a truly advanced form of intelligence out there in the universe, then it’s probably advanced enough to run simulations of entire worlds — maybe trillions of them — maybe even our own.</p><p>你们在学校大楼里研究些厉害的事物。我告诉你们我在想些什么：模拟理论。牛津大学尼克·博斯特罗姆曾假定，如果宇宙真有一种先进的智能在，或许可以先进到模拟所有世界，也许有数百万个世界在，也许甚至模拟我们自己的世界。</p><p>The basic idea is that we could be living in a massive simulation run by a far smarter civilization, a giant computer game, and we don’t even know it. What if this—all of this—is a simulation?</p><p>基本想法就是我们可能生活在超级大型的模拟中，由比我们聪慧得多的文明或者巨型电脑游戏控制着，而我们却不自知。如果这一切真的是模拟呢？</p><p>But then again: what if it isn’t a simulation? Either way, what we do matters. What we do affects the outcome. MIT, you’ve got to go out and do really interesting things. Important things. Inventive things. Because this world … real or imagined … this world has some problems we need you to drop everything and solve.</p><p>当然，如果这一切又不是模拟呢？无论怎样，我们的所为会影响结果。麻省理工的学生，你们要走出去，做真正有意思的事情、重要的事情、有创造力的事情。因为这个世界，无论真实也好，想象也罢，都会有些问题需要你放下一切去解决。</p><p>But before you step out into our big, troubled world, I want to pass along a piece of advice that Bill Clinton offered me a little over a decade ago. What he said was “turn toward the problems you see.”Turn toward the problems you see. <strong>Engage</strong> with them. Walk right up to them, look them in the eye. In my experience, there’s just no <strong>substitute</strong> for actually going and seeing things.</p><p>你们就要踏入这个纷繁的大世界，我想给你们一句赠言，这是比尔·克林顿十多年前给我的建议。他说“去面对你看到的问题。”去关注你看到的问题，参与其中，径直走过去，直视问题。以我个人的经验，没有什么可以取代真正去面对、去看事物了。</p><p><img src="/2019/02/01/马特达蒙麻省理工2016毕业演讲/2.jpg" alt=""></p><p>When I was a teenager, Mom thought it was important for us to see the world outside of Boston. I think it was that same impulse that took my brother and me to Zambia in 2006, as part of the ONE Campaign — the organization to fight poverty and preventable disease in the developing world. On that trip, in a small community, I met a girl and walked with her to a nearby bore well where she could get clean water.</p><p>我十几岁的时候，我妈妈觉得带我们走出波士顿看看很重要，我觉得，我和我兄弟2006年成为ONE运动的一份子，走进赞比亚也是出于同样的动力。ONE运动这一组织力求在发展中国家战胜贫穷、预防疾病。那次旅途中，在一个小型社区里，我遇见了一个女孩，和她一起去附近的一个钻井汲取干净的水源。</p><p>And water goes hand-in-hand with sanitation. And getting out in the world and meeting people like this little girl is what put me on the path to starting Water.org. You see some tough things out there. But you also see life- changing joy. And it all changes you.</p><p>水和卫生息息相关。走出去到世界上，正是遇见小女孩这样的人让我走上了开启Water.org之路。你会看到世上的困难，但你也看到改变世界的快乐。这一切都改变着你。</p><p>There was a refugee crisis back in ’09 that I read about in an amazing article in the New York Times. People were <strong>streaming</strong> across the border of Zimbabwe to a little town in northern South Africa called Messina. I was working in South Africa, so I went up to Messina to see for myself what was going on. Human beings will take your breath away. They will teach you a lot… but you have to engage. There’s a lot of trouble out there, MIT. But there’s a lot of beauty, too. I hope you see both.</p><p>2009年曾有难民危机，我曾在《纽约时报》读到一篇精彩的文章。人们涌向津巴布韦边境，前往南非北部一个叫摩西那的小镇。我当时在南非工作，所以我亲自就去摩西那看看究竟。人会使你屏息震惊、会教你很多，但你一定要融入。麻省理工的学子们，那里困难重重，但也充满美好，我希望你们两者都能看到。</p><p>The point is to try to eliminate your <strong>blind spots</strong> — the things that keep us from grasping the bigger picture. But looking at the world as it is, and engaging with it, is the first step toward finding our blind spots. There’s a few more things I hope you’ll keep in mind.</p><p>关键是，要努力去除你的盲点、那些阻止我们看到全貌的事物。但看到事物的原貌，融入其中，还只是我们找到盲点的第一步。还有其它事情我希望你们牢记。</p><p>First, you’re going to fail sometimes, and that’s a good thing. Not having an answer isn’t embarrassing. It’s an opportunity. Don’t be afraid to ask questions.</p><p>第一，你有时候会失败，这是好事情。没有答案并不难堪，这是机会，所以不要害怕提问。</p><p>The second thing is that you’ve got to keep listening. Even outside your work, there are ways to keep challenging yourself. Listen to online lectures. I love what President Obama said at Howard University’s commencement last month: he said,“Democracy requires compromise, even when you are 100 percent right.”</p><p>第二是你要保持聆听。即便是工作之外，也有方法可以挑战自我。去听网上的讲座。我喜欢<a href="http://www.hjenglish.com/zt/obama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">奥巴马</a>上个月在霍华德大学毕业典礼说的话，“民主需要妥协，即便你百分百正确。”</p><p>The third and last thought I want to leave you with is that not every problem has a high-tech solution. We need to be just as <strong>innovative</strong> in public policy.</p><p>第三、也是最后我想寄予你们的，不是所有的问题都有高科的解决方案。我们的国家政策需要有所创新。</p><p>So, graduates, let me ask you this in closing: What do you want to be a part of? What’s the problem you’ll try to solve? Whatever your answer, it’s not going to be easy.</p><p>所以，毕业生们，让我问你们一个问题以此作结。你想成为什么的一份子？你想解决什么问题？无论你的回答为何，都不会是轻而易举。</p><p>Here you are alive at a time when science and technology may not hold all the answers, but are indispensable to any solution.</p><p>你们所处的时代，科学和技术或许不能解决一切，但所有的解决方案都离不开科技。</p><p>So I hope you’ll turn toward the problem of your choosing … Because you must. I hope you’ll drop everything … Because you must And I hope you’ll solve it. Because you must. Your game begins: now. Congratulations and thanks very much!</p><p>所以，我希望你们正视你们的选择问题，因为你们必须如此。我希望你们可以放下一切，因为你们必须如此。我希望你们可以解决这个问题，因为你们必须如此。你们的竞赛，现在开始。祝贺你们！非常感谢。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/2019/02/01/What-I-learned-at-work-this-year/1.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Every Christmas when I was a kid, my parents would send out a card with an update on what the family was up to. <em>Dad’s law firm is growing, Mom’s volunteer work is going strong, the girls are doing well in school, Bill is a handful.</em></p><p>Some people think it is corny, but I like the tradition. These days, at the end of each year, I still enjoy taking stock of my work and personal life. What was I excited about? What could I have done better?</p><p>I thought I would share a few of these thoughts as 2018 concludes.</p><p>One thing that occurs to me is that the questions I am asking myself at age 63 are very different from the ones I would have asked when I was in my 20s.</p><p>Back then, an end-of-year assessment would amount to just one question: Is Microsoft software making the personal-computing dream come true?</p><p>Today of course I still assess the quality of my work. But I also ask myself a whole other set of questions about my life. Did I devote enough time to my family? Did I learn enough new things? Did I develop new friendships and deepen old ones? These would have been laughable to me when I was 25, but as I get older, they are much more meaningful.</p><p>Melinda has helped broaden my thinking on this point. So has Warren Buffett, who says his measure of success is, “Do the people you care about love you back?” I think that is about as good a metric as you will find.</p><p>It may sound grand, but I think the world is slowly going through a similar transition to a broader understanding of well-being. For most of human history, we have been focused on living longer by fighting disease and trying to grow enough food for everyone. As a result, life spans have gone up dramatically. Technology has played a key role in that through vaccines, medicines, and improved sanitation.</p><p>We still need a lot of innovation to solve problems like malaria or obesity, but we are also going to be focusing more on improving the quality of life. I think this will be the thrust of many big breakthroughs of the future. For example, software will be able to notice when you’re feeling down, connect you with your friends, give you personalized tips for sleeping and eating better, and help you use your time more efficiently.</p><p>There are not the same clear measures of these things as there are for diseases, and there may never be. But there is nascent work in this field and I think it is going to accelerate.</p><p>As I look back on the year, I am also thinking about the specific areas I work on. Some of this is done through our foundation but a lot of it (such as my work on energy and Alzheimer’s work) is not. What connects it all is my belief that innovation can save lives and improve everyone’s well-being. A lot of people underestimate just how much innovation will make life better.</p><p>Here are a few updates on what’s going well and what isn’t with innovation in some areas where I work.</p><h3 id="Alzheimer’s-disease"><a href="#Alzheimer’s-disease" class="headerlink" title="Alzheimer’s disease"></a>Alzheimer’s disease</h3><blockquote><p>I saw two positive trends in Alzheimer’s research in 2018.</p></blockquote><p>I saw two positive trends in Alzheimer’s research in 2018.</p><p>One is that researchers focused on a new set of ideas about how to stop Alzheimer’s.</p><p>The first generation of theories, which dominated the field for years, emphasized two proteins called amyloid and tau. These proteins cause plaques and tangles in the brain, clogging up and killing brain cells. The idea was to stop the plaques and tangles from forming. I hope these approaches pay off, but we have not seen much evidence that they will.</p><p>In the past year, researchers have doubled down on a second generation of hypotheses. One theory is that a patient’s brain cells break down because their energy producers (called mitochondria) wear out. Another is that brain cells break down because part of the immune system gets overactivated and attacks them.</p><p>This is a great example of how improving our understanding of biology will reduce both medical costs and human suffering.</p><p>The other trend this year is that the Alzheimer’s community focused on getting more and better access to data. We’re working with researchers to make it easier for them to share information from their studies broadly so that we can better understand questions like how the disease progresses.</p><p>Over the past few years, the U.S. government has dramatically stepped up funding for Alzheimer’s research, from $400 million a year to over $2 billion a year. There is also a big push to create better diagnostics.</p><p>The only problem where I don’t yet see a clear path forward yet is how to develop more efficient ways to recruit patients for clinical trials. Without a simple and reliable diagnostic for Alzheimer’s, it’s hard to find eligible people early enough in the disease’s progression who can participate in trials. It can take years to enroll enough patients. If we could find a way to pre-screen participants, we could start new trials more quickly.</p><p>But there is so much momentum in other areas—scientific tools, better diagnostics, improved access to data—that as long as we can solve the recruitment problem, I am confident that we will make substantial progress in the next decade or two.</p><h3 id="Polio"><a href="#Polio" class="headerlink" title="Polio"></a>Polio</h3><blockquote><p> I thought we would be closer to eradicating polio today than we are.</p></blockquote><p>I thought we would be closer to eradicating polio today than we are. Unfortunately, there were more cases in 2018 than in 2017 (29 versus 22).</p><p>I underestimated how hard it would be to vaccinate children in places where there’s political violence and war. Families move around to escape fighting, which makes it hard to keep track of children and make sure they get all the doses of the vaccine. Or sewage systems get destroyed, allowing the virus to spread as children come into contact with an infected person’s excrement.</p><p>This is a key reason why Afghanistan and Pakistan have never been free of polio—in fact they are the <em>only</em> two countries that have never been free of polio.</p><p>I spend a lot of time on polio, part of it talking to the funders to make sure they continue their commitment even though eradication is taking longer than any of us would like. I remind them of the huge benefits of success, and the risk that the disease will return in a big way if we don’t finish the job.</p><p>I also remind them what a difference innovation is making. We’re now able to test sewage samples to track the virus and find the source before an outbreak starts. And the global health community is finding creative ways to work in war zones, having stopped outbreaks in Syria and Somalia in recent years.</p><p>Finally, I am hopeful about a new oral vaccine being tested in Belgium and Panama. The results should be out in 2019, and if this one proves effective, it would overcome some of the problems with previous oral vaccines when they’re used in places where few children are immunized. The new vaccine could be in use as soon as 2020.</p><p>Despite all the challenges, I am still optimistic that we can eradicate polio soon.</p><h3 id="Energy"><a href="#Energy" class="headerlink" title="Energy"></a>Energy</h3><p>Global emissions of greenhouse gases went up in 2018. For me, that just reinforces the fact that the only way to prevent the worst climate-change scenarios is to get some breakthroughs in clean energy.</p><p>Some people think we have all the tools we need, and that driving down the cost of renewables like solar and wind solves the problem. I am glad to see solar and wind getting cheaper and we should be deploying them wherever it makes sense.</p><p>But solar and wind are intermittent sources of energy, and we are unlikely to have super-cheap batteries anytime soon that would allow us to store sufficient energy for when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. Besides, electricity accounts for only 25% of all emissions. We need to solve the other 75% too.</p><p>This year Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the clean-energy investment fund I’m involved with, announced the first companies we’re putting money into. You can see the list at <a href="http://www.b-t.energy/ventures/our-investment-portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.b-t.energy/ventures/our-investment-portfolio/</a>. We are looking at all the major drivers of climate change. The companies we chose are run by brilliant people and show a lot of promise for taking innovative clean-energy ideas out of the lab and getting them to market.</p><p>Next year I will speak out more about how the U.S. needs to regain its leading role in nuclear power research. (This is unrelated to my work with the foundation.)</p><p>Nuclear is ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source that’s available 24 hours a day. The problems with today’s reactors, such as the risk of accidents, can be solved through innovation.</p><p>The United States is uniquely suited to create these advances with its world-class scientists, entrepreneurs, and investment capital.</p><blockquote><p> Unfortunately, America is no longer the global leader on nuclear energy that it was 50 years ago.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, America is no longer the global leader on nuclear energy that it was 50 years ago. To regain this position, it will need to commit new funding, update regulations, and show investors that it’s serious.</p><p>There are several promising ideas in advanced nuclear that should be explored if we get over these obstacles. TerraPower, the company I started 10 years ago, uses an approach called a traveling wave reactor that is safe, prevents proliferation, and produces very little waste. We had hoped to build a pilot project in China, but recent policy changes here in the U.S. have made that unlikely. We may be able to build it in the United States if the funding and regulatory changes that I mentioned earlier happen.</p><p>The world needs to be working on lots of solutions to stop climate change. Advanced nuclear is one, and I hope to persuade U.S. leaders to get into the game.</p><h3 id="The-next-epidemic"><a href="#The-next-epidemic" class="headerlink" title="The next epidemic"></a>The next epidemic</h3><p>In 1918, the Spanish flu killed 50 million people worldwide. It still ranks as one of the deadliest natural disasters ever.</p><p>I had hoped that hitting the 100th anniversary of this epidemic would spark a lot of discussion about whether we’re ready for the next global epidemic. Unfortunately, it didn’t, and we still are not ready.</p><p>People rightly worry about dangers like terrorism and climate change (and, more remotely, an asteroid hitting the Earth). But if anything is going to kill tens of millions of people in a short time, it will probably be a global epidemic. And the disease would most likely be a form of the flu, because the flu virus spreads easily through the air. Today a flu as contagious and lethal as the 1918 one would kill nearly 33 million people in just six months.</p><p>I have been <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Shattuck-Lecture?WT.mc_id=12_29_2018_21_YIR2018_BG-LI_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studying this</a> for <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/We-Are-Not-Ready-for-the-Next-Epidemic?WT.mc_id=12_29_2018_21_YIR2018_BG-LI_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several years</a>. To be prepared, we need a plan for national governments to work together. We need to think through how to handle quarantines, make sure supply chains will reach affected areas, decide how to involve the military, and so on. There was not much progress on these questions in 2018.</p><blockquote><p> There has been progress toward a vaccine that would protect you from every strain of the flu.</p></blockquote><p>The good news is that there has been progress toward a vaccine that would protect you from every strain of the flu. This year I visited the U.S. National Institutes of Health in Maryland and got an update from some of the people leading this work.</p><p>The challenges of making a universal flu vaccine are fascinating. All strains of the virus have certain structures in common. If you’ve never been exposed to the flu, it’s possible to make a vaccine that teaches your immune system to look for those structures and attack them. But once you’ve had the flu, your body obsesses over the strain that got you sick. That makes it really hard to get your immune system to look for the common structures.</p><p>So it is clear how we could make a universal vaccine that would protect anyone (such as the very young) who has never been exposed to the flu before. But for anyone who has already had the virus, it is a lot harder. The problem is a long way from being solved, but new research money is coming in and more scientists are working on it.</p><p>To make the most of these scientific efforts (<a href="https://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2018/05/Ending-the-Pandemic-Threat-A-Grand-Challenge-for-Universal-Influenza-Vaccine-Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of which</a> our foundation is funding), the world needs to develop a global system for monitoring and responding to epidemics. That is a political matter that requires international cooperation among government leaders. This issue deserves a lot more focus.</p><h3 id="Gene-editing"><a href="#Gene-editing" class="headerlink" title="Gene editing"></a>Gene editing</h3><p>Gene editing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/gene-editing-babies-china.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fasia&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=asia&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=10&amp;pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made the news</a> in November when a Chinese scientist announced that he had altered the genes of two baby girls when they were embryos. What is unprecedented about his work is that he edited their germline cells, meaning the changes will be passed down to their children. (The other, less controversial type of gene editing involves somatic cells, which aren’t inherited by future generations.)</p><p>I agree with those who say this scientist went too far. But something good can come from his work if it encourages more people to learn and talk about gene editing. This might be the most important public debate we haven’t been having widely enough.</p><p>The ethical questions are enormous. Gene editing is generating a ton of optimism for treating and curing diseases, including some that our foundation works on (though we fund work on altering crops and insects, not humans). But the technology could make inequity worse, especially if it is available only for wealthy people.</p><p>I am surprised that these issues haven’t generated more attention from the general public. Today, artificial intelligence is the subject of vigorous debate. Gene editing deserves at least as much of the spotlight as AI.</p><p>I encourage you to read up on it whenever you have a chance. Keep an eye out for articles in your news feed. If you are willing to read a whole book, <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Gene?WT.mc_id=12_29_2018_21_YIR2018_BG-LI_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Gene</em></a> by Siddhartha Mukherjee is very well done. This story is one to follow, because big breakthroughs—some good, some worrisome—are coming.</p><h3 id="Looking-ahead"><a href="#Looking-ahead" class="headerlink" title="Looking ahead"></a>Looking ahead</h3><p>Although I have never been one for New Year’s resolutions, I have always been committed to setting clear goals and making plans to achieve them. As I get older, these two things look more and more like the same exercise. So I am making a resolution for 2019. I am committing to learn and think about two key areas where technology has the potential to make an enormous impact on the quality of our lives, but also raises complex ethical and social considerations.</p><p>One is the balance between privacy and innovation. How can we use data to gain insights into education (like which schools do the best job of teaching low-income students) or health (like which doctors provide the best care for a reasonable price) while protecting people’s privacy?</p><p>The other is the use of technology in education. How much can software improve students’ learning? For years we have been hearing overheated claims about the huge impact that technology would have on education. People have been right to be skeptical. But I think things are finally coming together in a way that will deliver on the promises.</p><p>I will be posting updates on these and other issues here on LinkedIn and on my blog, the <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/?WT.mc_id=12_29_2018_21_YIR2018_BG-LI_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gates Notes</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, Melinda and I are working on our next Annual Letter. The theme is a surprise, though it is safe to say we’ll be sharing some positive trends that make us optimistic about the future. We’ll send the letter out in February.</p><p>I hope you have a happy and healthy start to 2019.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the end of 2018 marks the 40th anniversary of Deng Xiaoping and China’s other leaders opening up and reforming China and since this is also a time of greater questioning of China’s economic future, it is a good time to reflect on how China’s last 40 years have gone and why.  </p><p>The table below shows just a few representative statistics. These results speak for themselves. To have such rates of improvements in so many areas and for so many people has made it the greatest economic miracle ever. Clearly whatever they did worked great. So, what was behind these accomplishments and will they continue?</p><p><img src="/2019/02/01/Looking-Back-on-the-Last-40-Years-of-Reforms-in-China/1.png" alt=""></p><p>Since I have been fortunate to have experienced 34 years of this 40 years in an up close and intimate way, and since I study what makes countries succeed and fail, I have some experiences and thoughts to share    This is a retrospective look at China. A more comprehensive report about the current state of the economy and what is likely to come will follow shortly.</p><p>From what I have seen, I believe that the very impressive results that the Chinese leadership and the Chinese people produced came about primarily because of the powerful combination of a) China’s opening up and reforming following an extended period of isolation that led to a fast catching up (especially in the coastal regions of China) with the advanced developed world, and b) the power of the Chinese culture and it’ related ways of operating. </p><p>My first exposure to this came in 1984 when China was just opening. I was invited by CITIC (which was the only “window company,” which means the only company that was allowed to freely deal with the outside world) to teach them how the world financial markets work.  I immediately got a taste for the culture and could see that China was undeveloped for different reasons than other underdeveloped countries. In China’s case, the people and culture were highly developed and suffered from isolation from the advances that occurred in the rest of the world (whereas in most other developed countries the reverse was the case). </p><p>As an example of how undeveloped China was at the time because of lack of contact with the outside world, I gave senior people $10 calculators which they then thought were miraculous. To give you an idea of the rate of progress since then, some of those people are now overseeing the development of some of the most cutting-edge technologies in the world. </p><p>Back in 1984, I saw that there was nothing about the Chinese people that prevented them from being as successful as those in the developed world, and I knew that China was opening its door, I could imagine the essence of the big changes that would occur. Because the closed door was a barrier that led to two different economic levels to exist between China and the developed world, the removal of that barrier would naturally equalize their economic levels like unconstrained water naturally seeks the same level. I remember being on the 10th floor of CITIC’s “Chocolate Building,” giving a lecture and pointing out the window to the two-story <em>hutongs</em> (poor neighborhoods) and telling my audience that it would not be long before the <em>hutongs</em> would be gone and skyscrapers would be there in their place. They didn’t believe me and told me “you don’t know China,” and I told them they did not know the power of the economic arbitrages that would happen as a result of opening up. That opening was the biggest force behind the high rates of improvement that we saw over the last 40 years.  </p><p>While the opening up created a great natural opportunity, the Chinese made the most of it. They did that by making and implementing reforms that were driven by uniquely Chinese cultural influences. These reforms freed up the Chinese people to realize their potential. </p><p>When I first came to China, in addition to seeing that it was undeveloped because of its isolation, I saw that it was underdeveloped because it was run by an old-style communist system that provided little incentives or efficiencies. For example, people couldn’t choose their own careers and jobs, there were no private businesses allowed, government businesses (i.e., all business) were inefficiently run, and there were little or no incentives for working hard and doing a good job. In the years that followed, I saw numerous excellent and rapid reforms change all that. Even more important than my getting to see the particular reforms that they made, I got to see how they make reforms – I.e., how they come up with numerous big reform ideas, plan them out, get behind them, and then get them done.  The demonstrated ability of the Chinese to go from visualizations to actualizations is quite amazing.        </p><p>For example, in 1989 I was introduced by my CITIC friend and contact Wang Li to a group of seven good people (which she was one of) who were appointed by nine companies at the request of the visionary reformer Wang Qishan to create an organization (the Stock Exchange Executive Council) to set up the first financial markets in China. China was still very poor, so their office was in a dingy hotel and they lacked adequate funding. Still they had what mattered most—i.e., a clear mission to create big changes, smart people of good character, open-mindedness to allow rapid learning and determination to achieve their goals. Over the decades that followed, I saw how they and many others built the Chinese financial markets to become among the largest in the world, and I got to participate in small ways, which has been one of the great joys of my life. Through all this I gained a love and respect for the Chinese people, the Chinese culture, and their rapid rates of improvements that these forces brought about. .</p><p>As an extension of these sentiments in 1995, I had my 11-year-old son Matt live with an extraordinary and humble Chinese woman, Madame Gu, and go to a poor local school (Shi Jia Hu Tong Xiao Xue). All schools in China, like most everything else, were poor then. Though this school was poor (e.g., there wasn’t heat until late November so students wore their coats in classes), I saw how they had smart and caring educators who provided the children with an excellent, complete education that included character development. While Matt’s lifestyle was poor (e.g., he couldn’t take hot showers because the old apartment building he lived in only had hot water two days a week) he was superbly educated, loved, and better developed than in our rich Greenwich community. The experience changed his life forever and led him to set up a foundation to help Chinese orphans that he ran for 12 years that brought him and me into many more experiences with Chinese people and Chinese culture in China.</p><p>Through experiences like these and by getting to know some of the Chinese leaders, I learned a lot more about the Chinese culture, about how it operates today and about how it evolved over thousands of years —-from notions of how family members and others should behave with each other, through Confucian thinking, through Neo-Confucian thinking, through various dynasties and with the lessons these events provided about how leaders should lead and how followers should follow. These values and ways of operating are what I’m referring to when I refer to the Chinese culture, which I saw manifested over and over. I For example, I could see how that Chinese culture connected Lee Kuan Yew and Deng Xiaoping so that they together could explore how China could have a “socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics.” Though I’m no expert on Chinese culture and its way of operating, I do believe that I have some sense of it that might be helpful to those who haven’t had such exposures to it.</p><p>Most importantly, if you haven’t spent time in China, you need to get any stereotypes you might have out of your mind because it’s not how it was. This is not your father’s communism. It is “socialism with Chinese characteristics” that has been significantly and very effectively reformed, which has made it much more vital, creative, and economically free.</p><p>Before I share more of my thinking about this, I’d like to pass along <a href="https://www.transcend.org/tms/2018/12/xi-jinpings-speech-on-40th-anniversary-of-chinas-reforms-opening-up-full-text/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xi Jinping’s far more important observations about the last 40 years of reforms</a> and what to expect in the future. It is worthwhile reading for those who want to understand his perspective, which is most important.</p><p>President Xi refers a lot to “Chinese characteristics,” though he doesn’t define them.  While what defines Chinese culture would be better described by Chinese who are more knowledgeable than I am, I will refer you to the book Chinese Characteristics (<a href="http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b26028645.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) – an American observer writing about Chinese culture in the late 1800s, some of which I think resonates today (though I’ll note that don’t agree with everything in the book, some of which is very outdated). Still, I will inadequately describe what I think Chinese culture most fundamentally is. As I’m not a Chinese scholar so that my comments are made solely on the basis of my contacts and my limited research, please take what I’m saying with a grain of salt.</p><p>From my experiences and from what I am told by Chinese who should know, I believe Chinese leadership seeks to run the country the way they believe a good family should be run, from the top down, maintaining high standards of behavior, putting the collective interest ahead of any individual interest, with each member knowing their place and having filial respect for those in the hierarchy so the system works in an orderly way. One of China’s leaders who explained this concept to me told that the word “country” consists of two characters, state and family, which influences how they view their role in looking after their state/family. One might say that the Chinese government is paternal. For example, it regulates what types of video games are watched by children and how many hours a day they play them. As a broad generalization, when the interest of the country (like the family) is at odds with the interest of the individual, the interest of the country (like the interest of the family) should be favored over the interest of the individual. Individuals are parts of a greater machine. As a result of this perspective, the system seeks to develop, promote and reward good character and good citizenship. For example it gives people a social credit score that rates the quality of their citizenship. And each person is expected to view themselves as parts of the greater whole. This management from the top down includes visualizing what China 5, 10 and 20 years in the future should be like and then making and managing detailed multiyear plans to build out that vision, with the goal being to make China as great as it can be. China is run more like a giant company with many subsidiaries, some within the government’s direct control and some within its indirect control. </p><p>Over those 40 years, the economic system was reformed to allow much more market-oriented and freer pursuit of self-interest as long that pursuit is pursed with good citizenship (including respect for the ruling system and its rules),. That included having growth of the private sector and private property. </p><p>So what we have seen over the last 40 years is China making many big, practical reforms around a traditional Chinese way of operating. As Xi said in a recent speech, “we will reform the things that should be reformed and not reform the things that shouldn’t be reformed,” referring to having big changes while maintaining the traditional Chinese style governance system.</p><p>While Chinese culture has been evolving, it has at its most fundamental level been operating in similar ways for many hundreds or even thousands of years and the results of operating that way are knowable in an approximate way. I have recently been researching the rise and fall of reserve currencies, which led me to study the rises and declines of the world’s most powerful countries. That led my research team and me to put together the following indices of the relative powers of leading countries since 1500. These indices are a combination of six sub-indices that measure six different types of power: 1) innovation &amp; competitiveness, 2) domestic output, 3) share of world trade, 4) financial-center size and power, 5) military strength, and 6) reserve-currency status—and they show when different countries reached their peaks relative to the rest of the world. As shown, China was either the number one or number two most powerful country from 1500 to at around1800 when it went into relative decline that continued until around 40 years ago when the opening up and reforming led to the previously described strong ascent to being the second-most powerful country in the world and on the path to being the most powerful one. I believe that excellent performance was largely the result of China’s powerful culture and its reforms.   </p><p><img src="/2019/02/01/Looking-Back-on-the-Last-40-Years-of-Reforms-in-China/2.png" alt=""></p><p>The chart below shows each of the six measures of Chinese strength going back to 900.</p><p><img src="/2019/02/01/Looking-Back-on-the-Last-40-Years-of-Reforms-in-China/3.png" alt=""></p><p>The next chart shows our overall index going back to the year 900. As you can see, China has been a very successful country through the millennia except for the more recent 150 years or so (for reasons I won’t delve into now).</p><p><img src="/2019/02/01/Looking-Back-on-the-Last-40-Years-of-Reforms-in-China/4.png" alt=""></p><p>Given that impressive track record and how deeply imbued the culture behind it is, we shouldn’t expect China’s most fundamental ways of operating to change much. As a result, while trade deals can be made, attempts to change “Chinese characteristics”,—most importantly to change the top-down government management of most/all aspects of the system pursuit of making China as great as it can be—won’t work.</p><p>While considerable attention is now being paid to the trade war, what is more important is that China and the US are in a competition of cultural approaches, with the US approach being more opposite than similar to the Chinese approach Most fundamentally, the US is a country in which individuals, individualism, and individual property rights are perceived to be of paramount importance it is directed from the bottom up (e.g., through “one man, one vote” democracies that empower people to choose their leaders), being revolutionary is considered a good thing, and conflict is valued more than harmony. Rather than respecting top down control most American have a strong preference to keep government from interfering with their most individual choices. Character development is a personal or family issue, not a government issue (which leaves it largely neglected in areas with broken families, especially if they’re poor). Rather than there being a long-term top down vision for the country and a plan to achieve that vision, in the capitalist and democratic system such directions are more bottom up determined based on commercial and popularity considerations.</p><p>I’m not saying which system is better. Each culture/system has its pros and cons that I’m not going to get into now. I believe that the important thing to know are that while there will be trade wars and trade truces they aren’t the most important things. The most important things are that 1) China has a culture and system that has worked well for it for a long time so it shouldn’t be expected to change much, 2) the U.S. has the same, 3) these systems (and those of other countries) will be both competing and cooperating, and how well they do that will be an important influence on global conditions, 4) how well each system works in practice will have a far greater influence on where each country stands in the future than the terms of the deals that they strike with each other, so each would do well to examine its own weaknesses and come up with reforms to rectify them, and 5) there is a lot to respect about the Chinese culture and approach that led to its remarkable accomplishments, 6) we would do well to learn from each other, cooperate and compete to bring each other up rather than to tear each other down, and 7) China is a place we need to continue to evolve with and invest in. </p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>导读：绝大部分的留学生买车主要是为了方便上下学和日常的打工，甚至有一小部分学生喜欢开车出去旅游，澳洲又是开车特别舒服的国家(路宽人少风景美)，基于这些需求，选择一辆质量好，节油，价格实惠的汽车是大部分学……</p><ul><li><p>1、如何选购汽车的品牌</p><p>绝大部分的<strong>留学</strong>生买车主要是为了方便上下学和日常的打工，甚至有一小部分学生喜欢开车出去旅游，澳洲又是开车特别舒服的国家(路宽人少风景美)，基于这些需求，选择一辆质量好，节油，价格实惠的汽车是大部分学生的第一选择。</p><p>其实澳洲本土来说，丰田汽车是保有量最大的品牌，其次是马自达。在中国随处可见的大众汽车，在澳洲几乎很难见得到。原因是丰田的车维修起来，成本低，时间短，而且又节油。有个朋友买了奥迪A4，不小心撞了前保险杠，拿去维修，等了半年才修好······因为德国的配件需要从德国空运，价格不仅贵了两三倍，时间也要等很久。</p><p>划重点：如果不是非常喜欢德系车，建议在澳洲购买日系车，使用更加方便<br><img src="/2019/01/27/How-To-Buy-A-Car-In-Australia/3.jpg" alt="日系车"></p></li><li><p>2、去哪里买车呢?</p><p>如果是买新车的话，建议就去当地的4S店，这一点跟中国差不多，多逛几家4S店，多了解一些价格，然后砍到合理的价格就入手。这里需要搞清楚的就是，你看中的这款车是不是最新款，有些“不良商家”喜欢把16年的车说成是17年款，实际上你掏了一样的钱却买了旧款的车子。具体的汽车配置可以上汽车品牌官网查看，也可以上Carsales(澳洲最大的车辆交易网站，可以通过这个网站来查看车子的内外功能配置)</p><p>如果是买二手车的话，购买渠道就很多了，有私人二手车(Private)、二手车行(Dealer)、拍卖行(Auctions)这三种主流购买渠道。刚刚我们推荐的Carsales这个网站，很多人会在上面发布卖车信息(发布信息网站是要收费的)，私人二手车和Dealer二手车都可以在这个上面找到，以下图举例：</p><p><img src="/2019/01/27/How-To-Buy-A-Car-In-Australia/2.jpg" alt="二手车"></p><p>  除了Carsales还有Gumtree，Gumtree类似于我们国内的赶集网，58同城这种，发布信息都是免费的，所以导致信息真假和质量层次不齐，我们在这里就不推荐学生去这个网站搜索，Carsales已经可以满足大部分要求了(我们绝对没有收广告费!!工作室太小，Carsales也不认得我们o(╥﹏╥)o)</p><p>  Auctions主要拍卖的是政府的车，公里数比较高，车况一般，而且不能试车，国际驾照不能在拍卖行买车，所以我们就不多做介绍了。</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>3、如何判断这车可不可以买？</p><p>先说二手车行(Dealer)的车，二手车行也分大小，一般价位在5000澳币以内的车只有小车行卖，要求门槛也比较低，车况不一定很好。卖5000-10000澳币的车行在规模上会相对大一些，但是没达到4S店的规模。经手的车辆在性能上和可靠性上一般可以维持12个月的中上水准。1W以上的车大部分都是在连锁Dealer上卖了，例如国内的4S店，价格虽然偏贵，但是车况是很不错的。第一类车行肯定是不推荐的，因为价格本来就便宜，车行还要分一笔钱，可想而知那车品质也好不到哪里去。第二类车行呢可以考虑，不过也要对比价格和提供的服务，比如有些车行不提供完善的保修服务，这种情况就得看你能不能接受了。第三类车行肯定是强烈推荐的，但是呢也分好坏，据我朋友说他见过最好的是墨尔本东部某起亚4s店，提供5年全车部件的保修，还包括卖车时候的蒸汽清洁和全新轮胎。</p><p>接下来是私人二手车了，一般先在网上找到自己喜欢的二手车，然后约车主出来看车，一般建议约学校附近或者住宅区附近，千万别太偏僻了，女孩子家最好多找几个人陪同。如果有朋友懂车，那是最好的，让他陪你一起去看。</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>4、接下来的步骤非常重要</p><p>01、挑选好自己喜欢的车之后，根据车辆的Registration Number上MyRTA(RTA 是Roads &amp; Traffic Authority的简称)的网站花费25刀查阅该车辆的历史纪录，重点查看其有无重大事故发生(Written-Off)，以及车主记录——“前任”越少越好。</p><p>02、检查车辆的保养记录(Service Logbook)，查看车辆是否按期保养。</p><p>03、记得查看和拍照保存车主的身份证和车子的Rego(汽车上路缴的路费单)，检查名字是否一致，同时记下相关信息，方便以后查询。</p><p>04、二手车的牌照，在汽车转手时也需要从卖主转到卖主。卖主需要在交易完成时在Rego单背面签字，并尽快填写车辆过户表(Vehicle Registration Transfer Form)给买主，让其交到RTA完成车主转移。</p><p>05、过户要求带上驾照、驾照翻译件和护照(或学生卡)和地址的信件去路局进行过户。过户的时候购买价格可议根据自己需求而填写成交金额，因为过户费需要缴纳成交金额的百分比，所以成交金额填写的越高需要贡献给政府的税金也就越高。</p><p>06、由于RWC(去过户的时候强制要求的一张证明，差不多就是车辆的体检单，有效期为1个月，大部分汽车维修店可以做RWC证明)有效期仅为一个月，建议完成购买之后尽快去过户;如果买的是Dealer的车，一般都是Drive Away服务，就是交钱立马开走。如果是私人二手车，就得找维修店去做。</p><p>07、买完车之后记得一定要买汽车保险，不同的保险公司报价也不一样，可以多咨询多比较。澳洲的保险公司一般以RACV(不同州结尾不同)、AAMI、Allianz这三家公司为主。网上可以搜到不同的险种和价格，如果确定要买的话，直接打电话说你要买就好了，保险当时就生效。</p><p><img src="/2019/01/27/How-To-Buy-A-Car-In-Australia/1.png" alt="车险"></p></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今年有人提出了2018年微服务将疯狂至死，可见微服务的争论从未停止过。在这我将自己对微服务的理解整理了一下，希望对大家有所帮助。</p><p>1.什么是微服务</p><p>1）一组小的服务（大小没有特别的标准，只要同一团队的工程师理解服务的标识一致即可）<br>2）独立的进程（java的tomcat，nodejs等）<br>3）轻量级的通信（不是soap，是http协议）<br>4）基于业务能力（类似用户服务，商品服务等等）<br>5）独立部署（迭代速度快）<br>6）无集中式管理（无须统一技术栈，可以根据不同的服务或者团队进行灵活选择）<br>ps：微服务的先行者Netflix公司，开源了一些好的微服务框架，后续会有介绍。</p><ol start="2"><li>怎么权衡微服务的利于弊</li></ol><p>利：<br>强模块边界 。（模块化的演化过程：类–&gt;组件/类库（sdk）–&gt;服务(service)，方式越来越灵活）<br>可独立部署。<br>技术多样性。<br>弊：<br>分布式复杂性。<br>最终一致性。（各个服务的团队，数据也是分散式治理，会出现不一致的问题）<br>运维复杂性。<br>测试复杂性。</p><ol start="3"><li>企业在什么时候考虑引入微服务</li></ol><p>从生产力和系统的复杂性这两个方面来看。公司一开始的时候，业务复杂性不高，这时候是验证商业模式的时候，业务简单，用单体服务反而生产力很高。随着公司的发展，业务复杂性慢慢提高，这时候就可以采用微服务来提升生产力了。至于这个转化的点，需要团队的架构师来进行各方面衡量，就个人经验而言，团队发展到百人以上，采用微服务就很有必要了。<br>有些架构师是具有微服务架构能力，所以设计系统时就直接设计成了微服务，而不是通过单服务慢慢演化发展成微服务。在这里我并不推荐这种做法，因为一开始对业务领域并不是很了解，并且业务模式还没有得到验证，这时候上微服务风险比较高，很有可能失败。所以建议大家在单服务的应用成熟时，并且对业务领域比较熟悉的时候，如果发现单服务无法适应业务发展时，再考虑微服务的设计和架构。<br>4.微服务的组织架构</p><p>如上图左边，传统的企业中，团队是按职能划分的。开发一个项目时，会从不同的职能团队找人进行开发，开发完成后，再各自回到自己的职能团队，这种模式实践证明，效率还是比较低的。<br>如上图右边，围绕每个业务线或产品，按服务划分团队。团队成员从架构到运维，形成一个完整的闭环。一直围绕在产品周围，进行不断的迭代。不会像传统的团队一样离开。这样开发效率会比较高。至于这种团队的规模，建议按照亚马逊的两个披萨原则，大概10人左右比较好。<br>5：怎么理解中台战略和微服务</p><p>中台战略的由来：马云2015年去欧洲的一家公司supersell参观，发现这个公司的创新能力非常强，团队的规模很小，但是开发效率很高。他们就是采用中台战略。马云感触很深，回国后就在集团内部推出了中台战略。</p><p>简单的理解就是把传统的前后台体系中的后台进行了细分。阿里巴巴提出了大中台小前台的战略。就是强化业务和技术中台，把前端的应用变得更小更灵活。当中台越强大，能力就越强，越能更好的快速响应前台的业务需求。打个比喻，就是土壤越肥沃，越适合生长不同的生物，打造好的生态系统。<br>6：服务分层</p><p>每个公司的服务分层都不相同，有的公司服务没有分层，有的怎分层很多。目前业界没有统一的标准。<br>下面推荐一个比较容易理解的两层结构。</p><p>1：基础服务： 比如一个电商网站，商品服务和订单服务就属于基础服务（核心领域服务）。缓存服务，监控服务，消息队列等也属于基础服务（公共服务）<br>2：聚合服务 ：例如网关服务就算一种聚合服务（适配服务）。<br>这是一种逻辑划分，不是物理划分，实际设计的东西很多很复杂。<br>7：微服务的技术架构体系</p><p>下图是一个成型的互联网微服务的架构体系：</p><p>1：接入层 负载均衡作用，运维团队负责<br>2：网关层 反向路由，安全验证，限流等<br>3：业务服务层 基础服务和领域服务<br>4：支撑服务层<br>5：平台服务<br>6：基础设施层 运维团队负责。（或者阿里云）<br>8：微服务的服务发现的三种方式</p><p>第一种：如下图所示，传统的服务发现（大部分公司的做法）。服务上线后，通知运维，申请域名，配置路由。调用方通过dns域名解析，经过负载均衡路由，进行服务访问。缺点： LB的单点风险，服务穿透LB，性能也不是太好</p><p>第二种：也叫客户端发现方式。如下图所示。通过服务注册的方式，服务提供者先注册服务。消费者通过注册中心获取相应服务。<br>并且把LB的功能移动到了消费者的进程内，消费者根据自身路由去获取相应服务。优点是，没有了LB单点问题，也没有了LB的中间一跳，性能也比较好。但是这种方式有一个非常明显的缺点就是具有非常强的耦合性。针对不同的语言，每个服务的客户端都得实现一套服务发现的功能。</p><p>第三种：也叫服务端发现方式，如下图所示。和第二种很相似。但是LB功能独立进程单独部署，所以解决了客户端多语言开发的问题。唯一的缺点就是运维成比较高，每个节点都得部署一个LB的代理，例如nginx。</p><p>9.微服务网关</p><p>网关就好比一个公司的门卫。屏蔽内部细节，统一对外服务接口。</p><p>下图是一个网关所处位置的示例图。</p><p>10：Netflix Zuul网关介绍</p><p>核心就是一个servlet，通过filter机制实现的。主要分为三类过滤器：前置过滤器，过滤器和后置过滤器。<br>主要特色是，这些过滤器可以动态插拔，就是如果需要增加减少过滤器，可以不用重启，直接生效。原理就是：通过一个db维护过滤器（上图蓝色部分），如果增加过滤器，就将新过滤器编译完成后push到db中，有线程会定期扫描db，发现新的过滤器后，会上传到网关的相应文件目录下，并通知过滤器loader进行加载相应的过滤器。</p><p>整个网关调用的流程<br>上图从左变http Request开始经过三类过滤器，最终到最右边的Http Response，这就是Zull网关的整个调用流程。<br>11：微服务的路由发现体系</p><p>整个微服务的路由发现体系，一般由服务注册中心和网关两部分组成。以NetFlix为例子，Eureka和Zull这两个组件支撑了netFlix整个的路由发现体系。如下图所示，首先外部请求发送到网关，网关去服务注册中心获取相应的服务，进行调用。其次内部服务间的调用，也通过服务注册中心进行的</p><p>12.微服务配置中心</p><p>目前大部分公司都是把配置写到配置文件中，遇到修改配置的情况，成本很高。并且没有修改配置的记录，出问题很难追溯。配置中心就接解决了以上的问题。<br>可配置内容：数据库连接，业务参数等等</p><p>配置中心就是一个web服务，配置人员通过后台页面修改配置，各个服务就会得到新的配置参数。实现方式主要有两种，一种是push，另一种是pull。两张方式各有优缺点。push实时性较好，但是遇到网络抖动，会丢失消息。pull不会丢失消息但是实时性差一些。大家可以同时两种方式使用，实现一个比较好的效果。如下图所示，这是一个国内知名互联网公司的配置中心架构图。</p><p>开源地址：<a href="http://github.com/ctripcorp/appollo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://github.com/ctripcorp/appollo</a><br>13：RPC遇到了REST</p><p>内部一些核心服务，性能要求比较高的可以采用RPC，对外服务的一般可以采用rest。<br>14：服务框架和治理</p><p>微服务很多的时候，就需要有治理了。一个好的微服务框架一般分为以下14个部分。如下图所示。这就是开篇所说的，微服务涉及的东西很多，有些初创公司和业务不成熟的产品是不太适合的，成本比较高。<br>目前国内比较好的微服务框架就是阿里巴巴的DUBBO了,国外的就是spring cloud,大家可以去研究一下.</p><p>15：监控体系</p><p>监控是微服务治理的重要环节。一般分为以下四层。如下图所示。</p><p>监控的内容分为五个部分：日志监控，Metrics监控（服务调用情况），调用链监控，告警系统和健康检查。<br>日志监控，国内常用的就是ELK+KAFKA来实现。健康检查和Metrics，像spring boot会自带。Nagios也是一个很好的开源监控框架。<br>16:Trace调用链监控</p><p>调用链监控是用来追踪微服务之前依赖的路径和问题定位。例如阿里的鹰眼系统。主要原理就是子节点会记录父节点的id信息。</p><p>下图是目前比较流行的调用链监控框架。</p><p>17：微服务的限流熔断</p><p>假设服务A依赖服务B和服务C，而B服务和C服务有可能继续依赖其他的服务，继续下去会使得调用链路过长。如果在A的链路上某个或几个被调用的子服务不可用或延迟较高，则会导致调用A服务的请求被堵住，堵住的请求会消耗占用掉系统的线程、io等资源，当该类请求越来越多，占用的计算机资源越来越多的时候，会导致系统瓶颈出现，造成其他的请求同样不可用，最终导致业务系统崩溃。<br>一般情况对于服务依赖的保护主要有两种方式：熔断和限流。目前最流行的就是Hystrix的熔断框架。<br>下图是Hystrix的断路器原理图：</p><p>限流方式可以采用zuul的API限流方法。<br>18.Docker 容器部署技术&amp;持续交付流水线</p><p>随着微服务的流行，容器技术也相应的被大家重视起来。容器技术主要解决了以下两个问题：<br>1：环境一致性问题。例如java的jar/war包部署会依赖于环境的问题（操着系统的版本，jdk版本问题）。<br>2：镜像部署问题。例如java，rubby，nodejs等等的发布系统是不一样的，每个环境都得很麻烦的部署一遍，采用docker镜像，就屏蔽了这类问题。<br>下图是Docker容器部署的一个完整过程。</p><p>更重要的是，拥有如此多服务的集群环境迁移、复制也非常轻松，只需选择好各服务对应的Docker服务镜像、配置好相互之间访问地址就能很快搭建出一份完全一样的新集群。<br>19.容器调度和发布体系</p><p>目前基于容器的调度平台有Kubernetes，mesos，omega。下图是mesos的一个简单架构示意图。</p><p>下图是一个完整的容器发布体系</p><p>在此我向大家推荐一个架构学习交流群。交流学习群号：478030634  里面会分享一些资深架构师录制的视频录像：有Spring，MyBatis，Netty源码分析，高并发、高性能、分布式、微服务架构的原理，JVM性能优化、分布式架构等这些成为架构师必备的知识体系。还能领取免费的学习资源，目前受益良多</p><p>大家觉得文章对你还是有一点点帮助的，大家可以点击下方二维码进行关注。 《Java烂猪皮》 公众号聊的不仅仅是Java技术知识，还有面试等干货，后期还有大量架构干货。大家一起关注吧！关注烂猪皮，你会了解的更多………….. </p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform</a> 是一个 IT 基础架构自动化编排工具，它的口号是 “Write, Plan, and create Infrastructure as Code”, 基础架构即代码。具体的说就是可以用代码来管理维护 IT 资源，比如针对 AWS，我们可以用它创建，修改，删除 S3 Bucket, Lambda, EC2 实例，Kinesis， VPC 等各种资源。并且在真正运行之前可以看到执行计划(即干运行-dryrun)。由于状态保存到文件中，因此能够离线方式查看资源情况 – 当然，前提是不要在 Terraform 之外对资源进行修改。</p><p>Terraform 配置的状态除了能够保存在本地文件中，也可以保存到 <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/consul.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consul</a>, <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S3</a>, azure, http, swift 等处。</p><p>Terraform 是一个高度可扩展的工具，通过 Provider 来支持新的基础架构，AWS 不过为目前官方内建 68 个 <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Providers</a> 中的一个。其他能用 Terraform 的地方有 Alicloud(阿里云, 实名制备案才能用), Google Cloud, Heroku, Kubernetes, Microsoft Azure, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Docker 等等。愿意的话可以写自己的 Provider, 如搞个 Kafka 的话，用来管理 Topic 等的创建，维护工作。</p><p>Terraform 之前我们对 AWS 的操作用的是 awscli, 或 <a href="https://serverless.com/framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Serverless</a>。awscli 什么都能做，但它是无状态的，必须明确用不同的命令来创建，修改和删除。Serverless 不是用来管理基础架构的，用它创建  Lambda 时创建资源都是很麻烦的事。AWS 提供的 CloudFormation 才是与 Terraform 较类似的工具，但是看到用法就头疼。</p><p>下面从最简单例子开始，看看怎么用 Terraform 创建，删改，修改 S3 Bucket。本地系统为 Mac OS。</p><p>\1. Terraform 安装</p><p>brew install terraform</p><p>安装后 shell 命令就是 terraform, 常用的是 terraform init, terraform plan, terraform apply</p><p>\2. 创建配置文件</p><p>像 git 一样，每个 Terraform 项目需要自己单独的目录空间，所以我们创建一个 terraform-learning 目录</p><p>mkdir terraform-learning</p><p>cd terraform-learning</p><p>该目录下的所有  <em>.tf 文件都会被 Terraform 加载，在初始化 Terraform 工作空间之前必须至少要有一个 </em>.tf 文件。我们这里建立文件 main.tf, 内容如下</p><p><img src="/Users/mark/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/142F3AD6-DFE0-4683-9528-F3115C02FEE4/pastedGraphic.png" alt="pastedGraphic.png"></p><p>Terraform 配置的语法是该公司 HashiCorp 独创的 <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HCL</a>(HashiCorp configuration language), 它可以兼容 JSON 格式。</p><p>上面 tf 文件在 Vim 中的语法加亮是安装的 hashivim/vim-terraform 插件。</p><p>我们写好了 *.tf 文件后可以调用 terraform fmt 对配置文件进行格式化，它比较喜欢被 Java 弃用的等号对齐的格式。</p><p>\3. 配置文件介绍</p><p>从正式跨入 terraform 命令正题之前先来大概的介绍一下上面那个 main.tf 文件。</p><p><strong>1)</strong> <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>provider “aws”</strong></a> <strong>部分</strong>，它指定选用什么 provider, 以及验证信息。aws 既允许指定 access_key 和 secret_key</p><p>provider “aws” {</p><p>​    region           = “us-east-1”</p><p>​    access_key  = “your-access-key-here”</p><p>​    secret_key   = “your-secret-key-here”</p><p>}</p><p>也能够指定证书文件中的 profile</p><p>provider “aws” {</p><p>​    region                                  = “us-east-1”</p><p>​    shared_credentials_file  = “~/.aws/credentials”   //不指定的话，默认值是 “~/.aws/credentials”</p><p>​    profile                                  = “yanbin”                        //不指定的话，默认值是 “default”</p><p>}</p><p>如果是使用 shared_credentials_file 中的 profile, 请确定您以预先生成好的 credentials 文件及有效的 profile。</p><p>更多关于 AWS Provider 的配置请参考 <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html</a></p><p><strong>2) resource “aws_s3_bucket” “s3_bucket”</strong> <strong>部分</strong></p><p>这只是我们今天举的一个小例子，点击链接 <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aws_s3_bucket</a> 查看 S3 Bucket 所有的配置项。Terraform 能够管理的所有 AWS 资源也能从前面那个链接中看到。</p><p>如果 bucket yanbin-test-bucket 不存在的话，运行 terraform apply 将会创建它，否则试图更新该 bucket。此例子只指定了 bucket 的 acl 和 tag 信息。terraform destroy 用来删除已存在的  bucket。</p><p>注意：terraform 配置文件中只指定要管理的资源对象，并不关心操作资源的行为–创建，修改，删除操作。操作行为与 Terraform 的状态有关系，无则创建，有则修改，更名会拆分为除旧立新两个操作，terraform destroy 用于显式删除资源。后面实例操作时会讲到。</p><p>注：resource “aws_s3_bucket” “s3_bucket” { 中，resource 后第一个是 type, 即资源名，第二个参是 name。其实 “s3_bucket” 在这里没什么用，只是一个描述或助记符而已。(2017-08-28): 更正一下，在作为变量引用的时候就要用到它，例如在后面要为 Lambda 创建一个 S3 Event 的 Trigger, 就要写成 event_source_arn = “${aws_s3_bucket.s3_bucket.arn}”, 引用时不需要知道实际的名称。</p><p>\4. 初始化工作目录</p><p>在初始化 Terraform 工作目录之前， 其他命令如 apply, plan 多是不可用的，提示需要初始化工作目录，命令是</p><p>terraform init</p><p>它要做的事情像是 git init 加上 npm install，执行完了 terraform init 之后会在当前目录中生成 .terraform 目录，并依照 *.tf 文件中的配置下载相应的插件。</p><p>\5. 执行 Terraform 管理命令</p><p>有了前面的准备之后，终于可以开始运行 Terraform 的管理命令了。Terraform 在正式执行之前提供了预览执行计划的机会，让我们清楚的了解将要做什么</p><p>terraform plan</p><p><img src="/Users/mark/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/142F3AD6-DFE0-4683-9528-F3115C02FEE4/pastedGraphic_1.png" alt="pastedGraphic_1.png"></p><p>由此计划还能知道关于 aws_s3_bucket 有些什么配置项，比如配置中可以加上 acceleration_status = “Enabled”</p><p>terraform apply</p><p><img src="/Users/mark/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/142F3AD6-DFE0-4683-9528-F3115C02FEE4/pastedGraphic_2.png" alt="pastedGraphic_2.png"></p><p>这样便在 AWS 上创建了一个 S3 bucket “yanbin-test-bucket”, 同时会在当前目录中生成一个<a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">状态</a>文件 terraform.tfstate, 它是一个标准的 JSON 文件。这个文件对 Terraform 来说很重要，它会影响 terraform plan 的决策，虽然不会影响到实际的执行效果。我们可以把它存到远端，如 S3 或 Consul。terraform state [list|mv|pull|push|rm|show] 用来操作状态文件。</p><p>此时什么也不改，再次执行 terraform plan, 会显示没什么要做的</p><p>aws_s3_bucket.s3_bucket: Refreshing state… (ID: yanbin-test-bucket)</p><p>No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.</p><p>如果对 main.tf 作点小改，改个 tag 属性，再次 terraform plan</p><p>~ aws_s3_bucket.s3_bucket</p><p>tags.Name: “Created by Terraform” =&gt; “sCreated by Terraform”</p><p>Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.</p><p>为什么说 terraform plan 是基于状态文件 terraform.tfstate 作出的呢？我们可以删除这个状态文件，然后执行 terraform plan 看看</p><p>+ aws_s3_bucket.s3_bucket</p><p>​    …..</p><p>​    bucket: “yanbin-test-bucket”</p><p>​    ……</p><p>​    tags.Environment: “QA”</p><p>​    ……</p><p>Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.</p><p>Terraform 由于缺乏 terraform.tfstate 对比，所以认为是要添加一个 bucket, 但是实际执行 terraform apply 时，连接到远端 AWS, 发现该 bucket 已存在就只是进行更新。terraform apply 总能给出正确的操作结果。同理如果状态文件中说有那个 bucket, terraform plan 会说是更新，但 AWS 没有那个  bucket，实际执行 terraform apply 也会进行添加的。</p><p>资源更名</p><p>如果把 main.tf 中的</p><p>bucket = “yanbin-test-bucket”</p><p>改成</p><p>bucket = “yanbin-test-bucket-rename”</p><p>即欲为 bucket 更名，用 terraform plan 看下计划</p><p><img src="/Users/mark/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/142F3AD6-DFE0-4683-9528-F3115C02FEE4/pastedGraphic_3.png" alt="pastedGraphic_3.png"></p><p>实际上 terraform apply 也是先删除旧的，再创建新的。Terraform 像 git 一样用不同颜色和  +/- 号来显示变动操作</p><p>最后是 terraform destroy 命令，把 *.tf 文件中配置的所有资源从 AWS 上清理掉。</p><p>关于 Terraform 工作目录中文件命名</p><p>Terraform 运行时会读取工作目录中所有的 <em>.tf, </em>.tfvars 文件，所以我们不必把所有的东西都写在单个文件中去，应按职责分列在不同的文件中，例如：</p><p>provider.tf                – provider 配置</p><p>terraform.tfvars      – 配置 provider 要用到的变量</p><p>varable.tf                  – 通用变量</p><p>resource.tf                – 资源定义</p><p>data.tf                        – 包文件定义</p><p>output.tf                    – 输出</p><p>以此篇最简单的入门出发，以后可以深入了解 Lambda, Lambda 触发器，及 API Gateway, EC2 实例怎么用 Terraform 来管理，也知晓了资源的可用属性应该到哪里去查。</p><p>一个小提示：在执行像 terraform plan 或 terraform apply 等命令的时候，可以按下 ctrl + c 让控制台输出详细的日志信息。</p>]]></content>
